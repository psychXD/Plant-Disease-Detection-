# Plany-Disease-Detection-
CNN model with background image removal 
Data Preparation:

Collected and cleaned a dataset of 80k plant images across 28 classes.
Preprocessed data by training the model on both images with background and images with background removed.
Model Selection:

Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for plant disease detection.
Training Strategy:

Conducted training on both datasets to evaluate the impact of background noise and outliers on model efficiency and accuracy.
Evaluation:

Assessed model performance on test data for both scenarios to compare the effectiveness of training with and without background images.
Results and Conclusion:

Analyzed results to determine the optimal approach for better efficiency and accuracy in plant disease detection, considering the influence of background noise and outliers.
